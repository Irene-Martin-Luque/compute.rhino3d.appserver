The proposed configurator aims to provide users with the possibility of generaing their own city.

The following are the customizable parametres that would be provided:

  b. A total of six reference points that would allow the user to draw the square's perimetre (gumball)
  c. The minimum lenght of the streets (slider)
  d. The maximum lenght of the streets (slider)
  e. The minimum distance between the streets (slider)
  f. Streets's width (slider)
