MaCAD at IaaC

Pluggins: DeCodingSpaces

The proposed configurator would aim to provide users with the possibility of generaing their own neighbourhood.

The following are the customizable parametres that would be provided:

  a. A total of six reference points that would allow the user to stablish the city's perimetre (gumball)
  b. A total of six reference points that would allow the user to draw the square's perimetre (gumball)
  c. The minimum lenght of the streets (slider)
  d. The maximum lenght of the streets (slider)
  e. The minimum distance between the streets (slider)
  f. Streets's width (slider)
  g. Plot's with (slider)
  h. Buildings' tipology (Checkbox/Slider)
      h.1 Residential
      h.2 Shops
      h.3 Cultural
  
  Project's workflow:
  
  1. 2D Grasshopper Definition
      1.1 Perimetre
      1.2 Streets and plots
      1.3 Buildings (to be modelled in Rhino)
  2. 3D Grasshopper Definition
      2.1 Smoothen the perimetre
      2.2 Terrain extrusion
      2.3 Streets offset
      2.4 Plots offset
  3. Detailed Buildings (at the central point of the plots)
  4. Customize java (plain background?)
  5. Customize httml (sliders on the left)
      Provide the user with the possibility of naming his/her city
  
  Questions:
      1. Is it possible to create a checkbox? 
      2. Is it the best way to add buildings?
      3. Could I provide the option of taking a screenshot to create a 'postcard'?
      4. AM I BEING TO AMBICIOUS?
